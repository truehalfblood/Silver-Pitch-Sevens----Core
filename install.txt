First of all, the files with extension.swift are onle text files with UTF-8 encoding, so any text editor can open it.

**Requirements
php and mysql.. My advice download xampp..

**Insall
create a database called testing, import to your database the .sql file form folder instal. 
you can change the database settings according to your server from the functions.php page.

NB: I hate typing(anything that aint code) and documentation so i know this install.txt file sucks.. lol
