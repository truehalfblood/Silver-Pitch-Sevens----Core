Silver-Pitch-Sevens----Core
===========================

A browser based management game for simulating the Rugby Union game for Seven aside players. 

When we refer to the term "Core" in this sense, it refers to the engine that powers this sort of games, or any other game
in that sense. The "Core" for sports based games are usually the match engines. This is the part of the game that simulates 
the results of the given match according to the given statics of either the team or individual players depending on what
sports it is.

This game basically seeks to emulate a Rugby Match and by extension theSeven ASide version of the game. The core is still 
at very early stages of it developmentt so nothing concrete yet. 

So summary, what i am building here ois the match engine for a browser based game that would eventually be 
***Silver Pitch Sevens***.
